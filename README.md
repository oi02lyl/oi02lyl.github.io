## About me

I joined the [Megagon Labs](http://www.megagon.ai/) as a research scientist.

I am a PhD graduate from [UC San Diego](http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/) (UCSD). My advisors are [Alin Deutsch](http://db.ucsd.edu/People/alin/) and [Victor Vianu](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~vianu/).
I am currently working on Verification of Data-driven workflows, a research direction that lies in the intersection of Database Theory, Software Model Checking and Business Process Management. Recently, I am also interested in high-level specification languages and automatic verification for smart contracts and Blockchain.
Before joining UCSD, I obtained my undergradate degree in Computer Science from [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk). During my undergraduate, I was also interested in Data Mining.

I was an intern in [Google Research](https://research.google.com/) during 2013 Summer and in [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-management-exploration-and-mining-dmx/) during 2014 Summer.
I was an intern in [IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/index.shtml) during 2017 Summer.
